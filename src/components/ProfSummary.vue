      <p>
        I am an engineer with a passion for technology and continuous learning. My strategic and
        analytical mindset, drawn from my love for chess and puzzles, drives my approach to
        problem-solving. I chose engineering for its logical foundations and the opportunity it
        provides for ongoing personal and professional development. Currently, I am pursuing a
        masterâ€™s in computer science with a specialization in Software Engineering, sparked by my
        growing interest in programming. My background includes mechanical and project experience,
        and I excel at communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders,
        fostering strong relationships with clients along the way. I am always eager to explore new
        ideas and challenges, continuously seeking ways to grow and contribute meaningfully in my
        field.
