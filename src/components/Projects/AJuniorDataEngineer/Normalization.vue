        Defined the project objective: to investigate potential links between suicide rates and
        influencing factors such as mental health funding, gender, and age demographics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Used AI-assisted generation to simulate realistic datasets aligned with the project's scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reviewed and cleaned the raw data, standardizing field names (e.g.,
        <code>location</code> vs. <code>region</code>) for consistency across all datasets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a PostgreSQL instance on Google Cloud and connected it to pgAdmin for remote database
        management.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uploaded cleaned datasets to the cloud database and organized them into a structured schema.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrote and tested SQL queries (joins, filters, aggregations) to examine patternsâ€”such as
        gender-based differences in suicide rates and correlations with mental health funding over
        time and by location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deployed a Firebase Cloud Function (v2) to securely query the PostgreSQL database and serve
        data to the frontend via API.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated the function into a Vue.js web application, enabling interactive visualization of
        the data and exploration of potential trends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assessed the findings and documented that, while the dataset is synthetic and not strongly
        correlated, the project effectively demonstrates the technical workflow of a full data
        engineering pipeline.
